### Meeting 8th of October

During this meeting, we focused on setting up the GitHub repository and ensuring that everyone in the team could access it correctly from their own computers. We went through the process of linking the repository to Eclipse, configuring the necessary settings, and verifying that each member was able to clone and push changes without issues.

Additionally, we organized a brief crash course on how to use GitHub effectively within Eclipse, covering basic commands such as committing, pulling, and pushing updates, as well as how to handle branches and resolve potential merge conflicts.

This session also served to make sure everyone understood the collaborative workflow we will follow throughout the project. By the end of the meeting, all members had successfully connected the repository to their local environment.

Finally, we established the fundamental team roles of leader and secretary, assigning responsibilities to ensure coordination and proper documentation of our future meetings and development progress.
